# Postbuild passes

The v3.0.0 baseline comes from `tools/transform_from_upstream.py`, which still needs
the uncommitted upstream workbook and stops at v3.0.0. Later passes start from the
committed `ozzit.xlsx` and `src/` recorded in ATTRIBUTION.md. This directory holds
the ones that are deterministic and safe to re-run.

## Run order

```bash
python tools/postbuild/fy27_help_text.py ozzit.xlsx src
python tools/postbuild/workbook_palette.py ozzit.xlsx
python tools/postbuild/gst_help_text.py ozzit.xlsx src
python tools/sync_afe_store.py ozzit.xlsx src
python tools/sanitise_workbook.py ozzit.xlsx   # always last, after any Excel save
```

All three postbuild passes are idempotent: on a current workbook each reports "already
applied" and writes nothing. A workbook whose anchors do not match the recorded counts
fails loudly rather than writing a partial result. `sync_afe_store.py` then copies the
five non-recursive `src/` modules into the workbook's Advanced Formula Environment
store; this step is required after a text pass changes `src/`. The FY27 and palette passes
record the v3.0.0 → v3.1.0 swaps. The GST help pass records a later insert against the
committed v3.1.0 workbook and `src/`.

## What is intentionally not here

**The FY27 cell-date shift** (`tools/postbuild/fy27_dates.ps1` in the v3.1.0 session) is
not re-runnable and is not ported. It computed each sheet's month offset from the sheet's
*current* earliest date and rewrote cells through Excel COM, so its result depends on the
workbook's state at the moment it ran. Two runs from different starting states give
different bytes. That is why ATTRIBUTION.md scopes the reproducible baseline to v3.0.0 and
states that byte-for-byte reproduction of the current workbook is not claimed.

The one-off scripts that produced v3.1.0 remain in the session record; the FY27 and
palette passes here are the parts of that work that are deterministic. The GST help pass
is a later committed-input insert, not a regeneration from upstream.
