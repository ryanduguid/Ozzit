# Postbuild passes

The v3.0.0 baseline comes from `tools/transform_from_upstream.py`. The current release
adds passes on top of that baseline. This directory holds the ones that are deterministic
and safe to re-run.

## Run order

```bash
python tools/postbuild/fy27_help_text.py ozzit.xlsx src
python tools/postbuild/luma_palette.py ozzit.xlsx
python tools/sanitise_workbook.py ozzit.xlsx   # always last, after any Excel save
```

Both passes are idempotent: on a current workbook each reports "already applied" and
writes nothing. A workbook whose anchors do not match the recorded v3.0.0 counts fails
loudly rather than writing a partial result.

## What is intentionally not here

**The FY27 cell-date shift** (`tools/postbuild/fy27_dates.ps1` in the v3.1.0 session) is
not re-runnable and is not ported. It computed each sheet's month offset from the sheet's
*current* earliest date and rewrote cells through Excel COM, so its result depends on the
workbook's state at the moment it ran. Two runs from different starting states give
different bytes. That is why ATTRIBUTION.md scopes the reproducible baseline to v3.0.0 and
states that byte-for-byte reproduction of the current workbook is not claimed.

The one-off scripts that produced v3.1.0 remain in the session record; the two passes here
are the parts of that work that are deterministic.
